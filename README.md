# Educational Management System

A console-based application designed to simulate an Educational Management System, inspired by platforms like Acadox. The system facilitates management of courses, assignments, and user roles such as Doctors, Teaching Assistants, and Students. Built as a foundational project to strengthen problem-solving and programming skills.

## Project Features

### For Doctors
- Create and manage courses (name, code, registered students).
- Create, view, and grade assignments.
- View course statistics and assignment reports.

### For Students
- Register for courses and view their course details.
- Submit assignment solutions.
- View grades and assignment statuses.
- Unregister from courses.

### Assignments
- Students can submit individual solutions.
- Doctors can set grades, add comments, and view assignment statistics.

### System Flow
- Sign up and sign in options for all users.
- Role-specific menus (Doctor, Student, or Teaching Assistant).
- Data persistence through file-based storage.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Data Storage**: File-based database simulation
- **Environment**: Console-based application

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mariam1341/Educational_mangment_system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   java Main
   ```

## Usage
- **Sign Up**: Create an account as a Doctor, Student, or Teaching Assistant.
- **Sign In**: Access role-specific features based on credentials.
- **Manage Courses**: Doctors can create courses, assign teaching assistants, and manage students.
- **Assignment Workflow**: Students can view, submit, and track assignments, while Doctors can evaluate and report on submissions.

## Screenshots
(Add screenshots of the main menu, course management interface, and assignment submissions for better visualization.)

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of encryption for sensitive data (e.g., passwords).
- Enhanced UI/UX through GUI implementation.
- Role-based notifications and messaging features.
- Advanced reporting capabilities (e.g., export to XML or CSV).
